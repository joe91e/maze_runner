# maze_runner
AngularJS / Python Flask / mongoDB / Redis maze solving application for learning purposes

The goal of this project is to learn and implement all main concepts of Object Oriented Programming in a full stack application.
Test coverage should be there from front to back

1) Initially, the application will use local JSON files as seeds to populate mongoDB and Redis data storage.
2) Eventually, the api server will accept json payloads to add more maze to the collection. 
(Back-end will validate the JSON payload to check if the payload is a valid maze).
3) User will simply choose which maze and which algorithm to use
4) Framework choice
Front-end: Bootstrap, AngularJS
Back-end: Flask, MongoDB & Redis
Testing: Karma / Protractor / Flask Unit test
